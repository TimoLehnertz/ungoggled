# ungoggled

Turn a Raspberry Pi 4 into an HDMI receiver for **DJI Goggles 3**, with a local
web interface for setup and monitoring.

Goggles 3 with both **O3 Air Unit** and **O4 Air Unit Pro** have been tested with
live HDMI output. Use the Pi's USB-C port for the goggles and power the Pi
separately.

## Features

- Hardware-decoded video over HDMI, with automatic 1080p mode selection.
- Configurable HDMI resolution and refresh rate from the display's supported modes.
- A selectable fallback image when video is lost or the receiver is stopped.
- Browser preview at up to **640 × 360, 5 fps**, independently switchable.
- Incoming resolution, measured camera fps, HDMI refresh rate and rendered fps.
- Raspberry Pi temperature and a **30-minute history**, sampled once per second
  and held in RAM.
- Wi-Fi access-point SSID and password controls.
- Automatic startup and recovery after USB disconnects or stream changes.
- Web updates with settings retention, startup checks and automatic rollback.
- New-release notices with GitHub release notes and download links.

## Hardware and wiring

You need a Raspberry Pi 4, microSD card of at least 8 GB, a USB-C data cable,
a micro-HDMI cable, Goggles 3, and a paired O3 or O4 Pro air unit.

1. Power the Pi separately through a suitable GPIO supply or PoE arrangement.
2. Connect **Goggles USB-C → Pi USB-C**. The Pi's rectangular USB-A ports do not
   provide the USB role used by this receiver.
3. Connect your display to **HDMI0**, nearest the Pi's USB-C port.
4. Confirm a live camera image inside the goggles.

For clean video, turn **Settings → Camera → Advanced Camera Settings → Camera
View Recording → OFF** in the goggles. Enable it to include their overlays.
The receiver cannot remove overlays already embedded in the incoming image.

## Install the SD-card image

The image is based on **Raspberry Pi OS Lite 64-bit, Debian 13 Trixie**.

1. Download `ungoggled-0.3.0-pi4-arm64.img.xz` from the release files.
2. Burn it to the microSD card. Recommended writers: Caligula (on linux), Raspberry Pi Imager (on windows)
3. Skip any OS customization the tool offers: the image already contains its
   network and login setup.
4. Verify the card, insert it into the Pi, and power on.
5. Join **ungoggled** using the password **ungoggled**.
6. Open **http://192.168.50.1**.

### Default credentials

| Setting | Default |
| --- | --- |
| Wi-Fi SSID | `ungoggled` |
| Wi-Fi password | `ungoggled` |
| SSH username | `root` |
| SSH password | `ungoggled` |
| Web interface | `http://192.168.50.1` |

Connect with `ssh root@192.168.50.1`. Change Wi-Fi credentials in the web
interface and the root password with `passwd` if desired. Application updates
preserve existing passwords; these defaults apply to freshly flashed images.

The root partition expands on first boot, and each device generates its own
SSH host keys. The image's Wi-Fi radio country is
**DE**; configure the correct country if using it elsewhere.

> Version 0.3.0 fixes two fresh-image issues found in 0.2.0: disabled Wi-Fi and
> V4L2 decoder rejection of the goggles’ H.264 level metadata. Live O3 decoding
> at 1080p30 and O4 captured-video decoding have been checked on Trixie. See
> [validation notes](FINDINGS.MD) for hardware test details.

## Use the web interface

**Start/stop** controls USB reception. **Reconnect goggles** restarts the USB
session. The display controller stays running so it can show the fallback image.

**Fallback image:** upload PNG, JPEG or WebP (up to 12 MiB), then select a
thumbnail. Images are converted to PNG, limited to 1920 × 1080 and displayed with
preserved aspect ratio. Up to 16 images can be stored. The selection survives
reboots; a “No signal” image is included.

**HDMI mode:** automatic mode prefers progressive 1080p at up to 60 Hz. You can
choose another advertised mode up to 1080p60. Applying a mode briefly interrupts
output. A 60 Hz HDMI signal may carry a 30 fps camera feed: the UI shows those
rates separately. It does not increase the camera frame rate.

**Preview:** this is a small live JPEG preview for framing and monitoring, not a
broadcast stream. Preview does not change the HDMI mode. Disable preview to
reduce processing and network traffic.

**History:** choose bitrate, frame rate or temperature, and hover over the chart
to inspect a sample. Shading marks periods without live video. History is cleared
when the application restarts; it does not write continuously to the SD card.

**Wi-Fi:** enter the SSID and a new password, then apply. Reconnect your computer
using those credentials. HDMI reception continues during the network change.
The web interface is intended for your private local network and has no separate
login; do not expose port 80 to the Internet.

## Update without reflashing

From version **0.3.0**, open **Software update** in the web interface:

1. Download `ungoggled-VERSION.update.tar.gz` from [GitHub releases](https://github.com/TimoLehnertz/ungoggled/releases).
2. Click **Upload update** and choose the file. The Pi checks its contents and checksums.
3. Review the version and click **Install**. Keep the Pi powered while it updates.
4. The interface reconnects and reloads when installation finishes.

Only **Raspberry Pi 4 with 64-bit Raspberry Pi OS (ARM64)** is supported.
The update contains the entire application: you can skip intermediate application versions. Only install update
files from releases you trust; checksums detect corruption, not publisher identity.

Compatible HDMI, preview and fallback settings are retained, as are uploaded
images, Wi-Fi configuration and passwords. Incompatible application settings use
defaults and are listed after installation. Video briefly stops and the RAM
history resets. If the new application fails its startup check, the previous
application and settings are restored. A recovery service handles interrupted
installations on the next boot. Keep at least **640 MiB** free on the root partition.

The browser checks GitHub hourly and shows a notice for a newer stable release.
Click it for release notes and a download link. This uses your browser's Internet
connection; the Pi itself can stay offline. Uploads work without Internet access.
Application updates do not replace Raspberry Pi OS, its kernel or media packages.
Downgrades are not supported.

### Upgrading an installation older than 0.3.0

Older software has no upload endpoint. Run this **once** over SSH to add it;
subsequent updates use the web interface. The same commands remain available as
a manual deployment path (replace `0.3.0` with the release you downloaded):

```sh
scp ungoggled-0.3.0.update.tar.gz root@192.168.50.1:/tmp/
ssh root@192.168.50.1
update_dir=$(mktemp -d /tmp/ungoggled-update.XXXXXX)
cd "$update_dir"
tar -xzf /tmp/ungoggled-0.3.0.update.tar.gz
./install.sh
```

The installer starts a background update and prints the web address. Installation
status is also saved in `/var/lib/ungoggled-update/state.json`; logs are available
with `journalctl -u 'ungoggled-update-*'`. A read-only legacy root filesystem
must be remounted writable before installing or changing settings.

## Manual installation on Raspberry Pi OS Lite

Install the runtime packages:

```sh
sudo apt update
sudo apt install gstreamer1.0-tools gstreamer1.0-plugins-base \
  gstreamer1.0-plugins-good gstreamer1.0-plugins-bad gstreamer1.0-libav curl
```

Add this to `/boot/firmware/config.txt` and reboot:

```ini
[all]
dtoverlay=dwc2,dr_mode=peripheral
```

Then install an ARM64 update as above, using your own Pi login and
`sudo ./install.sh` when logged in as a non-root user. Use the Pi's existing network address to
open the web interface on port 80. The application installer preserves your network configuration;
the preconfigured SD image additionally supplies the ungoggled access point.
The receiver needs exclusive use of the USB device controller and HDMI display.

## Build from source

Requires Rust stable with edition 2024 support, Node.js 24+, Python 3.11+ and npm.

```sh
cd web
npm ci
npm run build
cd ..
cargo test
cargo clippy --all-targets -- -D warnings
cargo build --release
```

On the Pi, install the resulting binary and web assets with:

```sh
sudo scripts/install-pi.sh target/release/ungoggled
```

To build the ARM64 update on Linux:

```sh
rustup target add aarch64-unknown-linux-musl
scripts/build-update.sh
```

Build the SD image with `scripts/build-image.sh`. It uses the checksum-pinned
official base image and installs packages inside an isolated ARM64 filesystem.
The Linux build host needs QEMU's registered `qemu-aarch64` binfmt handler,
subordinate UID/GID mappings, `unshare`, `newuidmap`, `newgidmap`, e2fsprogs,
curl, xz, Rust and Node.js. It does not write to a physical SD card. Outputs
are written to `dist/`: one image, one update, and their checksum files.
Intermediate bundles, release notes and build reports stay in `build/`.

For a hardware-free integration check, install GStreamer with its software H.264
and JPEG plugins, then run:

```sh
cargo build
python3 tests/smoke.py target/debug/ungoggled /path/to/captured-video.h264
```

## Versions and releases

`Cargo.toml` is the version source. Use stable semantic versions (`MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH`):

```sh
python3 scripts/version.py --set 0.3.1
# Add a matching "## 0.3.1" entry to CHANGELOG.md.
python3 scripts/version.py --check
```

Commit the changes and push a matching `v0.3.1` tag when ready to publish.
The release workflow builds for ARM64 and runs the tests, then creates a GitHub
release with notes from `CHANGELOG.md` and these assets:

- `ungoggled-VERSION-pi4-arm64.img.xz` — fresh SD-card installation.
- `ungoggled-VERSION.update.tar.gz` — complete application update for ARM64.
- SHA-256 checksum files for both downloads.

The update package format and migration entry point stay compatible with the
0.3.0 updater. Each target release handles migration from older settings; no
intermediate release is required. Build locally with `scripts/build-update.sh`
and `scripts/build-image.sh`. See [CHANGELOG.md](CHANGELOG.md) for release notes
and [the updater contract](docs/UPDATES.md) for maintenance details.

## Service and files

The service and persistent paths retain their original `dji-hdmi` names for
compatibility with existing installations. The application executable is
`ungoggled`.

| Location | Purpose |
| --- | --- |
| `dji-hdmi.service` | Receiver, renderer and HTTP server |
| `ungoggled-update-recovery.service` | Recover interrupted installations at boot |
| `/var/lib/ungoggled-update/` | Update progress, staging and rollback snapshots |
| `/opt/dji-hdmi/current` | Active application release |
| `/opt/dji-hdmi/releases/` | Installed releases |
| `/var/lib/dji-hdmi/` | Settings and fallback images |
| `/run/dji-hdmi/` | USB/video socket and GStreamer cache |
| `/etc/default/dji-hdmi` | Decoder/runtime configuration |
| `/etc/NetworkManager/system-connections/dji-hdmi.nmconnection` | Image's Wi-Fi AP profile |

```sh
sudo systemctl restart dji-hdmi
journalctl -u dji-hdmi -f
```

Rust handles USB, DJI framing, display management, settings and the Axum HTTP API.
GStreamer handles decoding and the small JPEG preview. The web application uses
React, TypeScript, Rsbuild and Tailwind. USB workers are supervised independently
of the persistent renderer.
