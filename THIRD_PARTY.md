# Protocol research and attribution

This implementation was written in Rust from the public AOA/Linux specifications,
public protocol facts and local hardware observations. Research downloads under
`research/upstream/` are ignored by version control and are not shipped with the
application.

  https://github.com/samuelsadok/dji_protocol . Exact revision and corrections are
  in FINDINGS.MD. No Python implementation is included in the application.

## Optional legacy decoder plugin

`scripts/build-legacy-omx.sh` downloads and builds unmodified gst-omx 1.14.4,
under its GNU LGPL 2.1 license. It is loaded into the external GStreamer process.
No GStreamer source or binary is embedded in the Rust executable. The archive,
checksum and build configuration are documented in FINDINGS.MD and the script.
Retain the upstream license and source when redistributing a built plugin.
